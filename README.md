# secure-password-gen
 This is a windows form application written in Visual Studio C# that can generate a secure password string based on the users preferences.
 The exe uploaded is ready to run and use.
 
 In file you can select or deselect the inclusion of special characters, since some sites require these in passwords and others simply
 won't allow them.

 Additionally from the file menu you can specify the length of characters for the generated string to be.
 
 In the future I'd like to add a way to save and manage accounts.
